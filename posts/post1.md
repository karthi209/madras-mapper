The Madras Tramway Proposals were put forward by the Madras Government in 1857 for â€˜experiments for using tramways instead of common roads were being carried out in the Madras Territories and may be used in the Punjab.

It would appear that Madras were experiencing problems in crossing unstable ground and river beds and were developing solutions using temporary tracks.

In 1936 a submission was made from the Government in Madras to the Directors of East India Company in London concerning two projects. One was the project to build a tramway for carrying road materials from St Thomas Mount. No costing was submitted and the Madras Gazette of 4 May 1836 had enquired why this project was taking place. The reply dated 19 September 1838 dismissed the proposal as a quotation was not attached and as there was no savings to be made. The scheme was discounted out of hand.

In 1842 a proposal was put forward to provide a stone tramway to connect south Madras to the outlying districts of Santhome and Mylapore. A bridge carrying over the Adyar River named the Elphinstone Bridge had been constructed about 1840 during the time of Lord Elphinstone, who was Governor of Madras from 1837 to 1842. The proposal was to construct a stone tramway on the existing bridge, presumably to convey carts pulled by bullock and extended over existing roads. A short length was constructed but in 1843 the experiment was abandoned.
